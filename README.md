Custom Raytracer
------------------------------------
About:
  This raytracer was made in 2021 in the second semester of my first year at university as my second assignment for the module "Programming and mathematics."
  Using a custom maths library it enables the ray tracer to render simple primitive ellipsoids with varying materials into a scene.
  However a very important thing to note is that currently this ray tracer is not real time as it only runs on 1 cpu thread.
